The aim of the _dataset_ package is to make tidy datasets easier to release, exchange and reuse. It organizes and formats data frame R objects into well-referenced, well-described, interoperable datasets into release and reuse ready form.

1. Offer a way to better utilise the `utils:bibentry` bibliographic entry objects by extending them with the fields of the Dublin Core and DataCite tenders, and making them detachable from the data. This extension aims to work with a [data.frame](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/data.frame) or an inherited [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/reference/tibble.html), [tsibble](https://tsibble.tidyverts.org/) or [data.table](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/). See for more information the [Bibentry for FAIR datasets](https://dataset.dataobservatory.eu/articles/bibentry.html) vignette.
2. Extending the `haven_labelled` class of the `tidyverse` for consistently labelled categorical variables with linked (standard) definitions and units of measures in our [defined](https://dataset.dataobservatory.eu/articles/defined.html) class.
3. Offering a new data frame format, `dataset_df` that extends tibbles with semantically rich metadata, ready to be shared on open data exchange platforms and in data repositories. This s3 class is aimed at developers and we are working on several packages that provide interoperability with SDMX statistical data exchange platforms, Wikidata, or the EU Open Data portal. Read more in the [Create Datasets that are Easy to Share Exchange and Extend](https://dataset.dataobservatory.eu/articles/dataset_df.html) vignette.

The primary aim of dataset is create well-referenced, well-described, interoperable datasets from data.frames, tibbles or data.tables that translate well into the W3C DataSet definition within the [Data Cube Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/) in a reproducible manner. The data cube model in itself is is originated in the _Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange_, and it is almost fully harmonized with the Resource Description Framework (RDF), the standard model for data interchange on the web^[RDF Data Cube Vocabulary, W3C Recommendation 16 January 2014  <https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/>, Introduction to SDMX data modeling <https://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/Session_4_SDMX_Data_Modeling_%20Intro_UNSD_WS_National_SDG_10-13Sep2019.pdf>].

Further development plans for peer-review are added in till 5 November 2024 here: 
[New Requirement](https://dataset.dataobservatory.eu/articles/new-requirements.html) setting.

The current version of the `dataset` package is in an early, experimental stage. You can follow the discussion of this package on [rOpenSci](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/553).

```{r initialise}
library(dataset)
iris_ds <- dataset_df(
  x = iris,
  reference = list(
    title = "Iris Dataset",
    author = person("Edgar", "Anderson", role = "aut"),
    publisher = "American Iris Society",
    source = "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x",
    date = 1935,
    language = "en",
    description = "This famous (Fisher's or Anderson's) iris data set."
  )
)
```

It is mandatory to add a `title`, `author` to a dataset, and if the `date` is not specified, the current date will be added. 

As the dataset at this point is just created, if it is not published yet, the `identifer` receives the default `:tba` value, a `version` of 0.1.0 and the `:unas` (unassigned) `publisher` field.

The dataset behaves as expected, with all data.frame methods applicable.  If the dataset was originally a tibble or data.table object, it retained all methods of these s3 classes because the dataset class only implements further methods in the attributes of the original object.

```{r summary}
summary(iris_ds)
```

A brief description of the extended metadata attributes:

```{r describe}
print(get_bibentry(iris_ds), "Bibtex")
```

```{r individualattributes}
paste0("Publisher:", publisher(iris_ds))
paste0("Rights:", rights(iris_ds))
```

The descriptive metadata are added to a `utils::bibentry` object which has many printing options (see `?bibentry`). (The `utils` package is installed by default with every R system, so working with utils is not an extra dependency.)


## Code of Conduct
Please note that the `dataset` package is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html). By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

Furthermore, [rOpenSci Community Contributing Guide](https://contributing.ropensci.org/) - *A guide to help people find ways to contribute to rOpenSci* is also applicable, because `dataset` is under software review for potential inclusion in [rOpenSci](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/553).
