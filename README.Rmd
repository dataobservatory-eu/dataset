# dataset: Semantic Metadata for Datasets in R

The `dataset` package provides tools to create semantically rich and interoperable datasets in R. Semantically rich datasets that are easier to: - understand by humans, - validate and process by machines, - and share across tools, teams, and domains.

It improves metadata handling by introducing new S3 classes—`defined()`, `dataset_df()`, and `bibrecord()`—that enhance the behaviour of `labelled`, `tibble`, and `bibentry` objects to meet the requirements of:

-   **Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange (SDMX)** standards,
-   **Open Science** metadata practices,
-   **Library and archive metadata** conventions (Dublin Core, DataCite).

Many tools exist to help document, describe, or publish datasets in R, but most separate the metadata from the data itself. This separation increases the risk of losing metadata, misaligning it with the data, or making documentation hard to maintain. We wanted to create a tooling that enables the user from the birth of a dataset till it is potentially serialised with the help of the [rdflib](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rdflib) package.

## Key Features

### `defined()`

An extended version of `labelled()` vectors. Adds support for:

-   Variable labels
-   Units of measure (e.g. "million euros")
-   Concept URIs (standardized definitions)
-   Namespaces (to support URI expansion)

```{r setup}
library(dataset)
data(gdp)
```

The following small dataset contains the gross domestic product (GDP) data of three small countries:

```{r}
print(gdp)
```

The `defined` vector class, an extension of the `labelled::labelled` class, allows to add machine-readable concept definitions and namespaces to reveal the coding of the variables. This will allow `AD` to be resolved as <https://dd.eionet.europa.eu/vocabulary/eurostat/geo/AD>

```{r defined}
geo <- defined(
    gdp$geo,
    label = "Country name",
    concept = "http://purl.org/linked-data/sdmx/2009/dimension#refArea", 
    namespace = "https://dd.eionet.europa.eu/vocabulary/eurostat/geo/$1"
    )

geo[c(1,3)]
```

See [defined: Semantically Enriched Vectors](https://dataset.dataobservatory.eu/articles/defined.html)

### `bibrecord()`

An extension of R's built-in `bibentry()` class, with support for:

-   Dublin Core Terms (`dcterms`)
-   DataCite metadata
-   Contributor roles (e.g. creator, publisher, data manager)
-   Subject tagging and geolocation

```{r bibrecord}
as_dublincore(orange_df)
```

This makes it easier to produce citations and metadata suitable for repositories like [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) or [Dataverse](https://dataverse.org/). See more in the [Modernising Citation Metadata in R: Introducing `bibrecord`](https://dataset.dataobservatory.eu/articles/bibrecord.html)

### `dataset_df()`

A semantic wrapper around `data.frame` or `tibble`, aligning with SDMX’s **data cube** model:

-   Variables (columns) can have units, labels, and definitions.
-   Observations (rows) can be assigned unique identifiers.
-   Datasets can carry complete metadata inline (title, creator, description, etc.)
-   Output can be serialized to linked data formats (N-Triples, RDF, etc.)

See more in the [dataset_df: Create Datasets that are Easy to Share Exchange and Extend](https://dataset.dataobservatory.eu/articles/dataset_df.html)

```{r mydata}
my_data <- dataset_df(
  country = defined(
    c("AD", "LI"), 
    concept =  "http://data.europa.eu/bna/c_6c2bb82d"),
  gdp = defined(c(3897, 7365), 
                label = "GDP", 
                unit = "million euros"),
  dataset_bibentry = datacite(
    Title = "GDP Data for Small Countries",
    Description = "Example Dataset for the dataset package",
    Creator = person("Jane", "Doe"),
    Publisher = "Open Data Institute",
    Rights = "CC0", 
    Language = "en"
  )
)
```

## From R to RDF

The **Resource Description Framework (RDF)** is a World Wide Web standard for describing and linking data in a structured way so that both humans and machines can understand it. Think of it as a common language for data: it allows you to represent information as simple *subject–predicate–object* statements (e.g., *“Dataset X has author Y”*). These statements can then be connected across different systems, making your data interoperable on the web.

-    **Machine-readability**: Your data and metadata are tightly coupled and structured for reuse; it contains all definitions to be imported into a foreign database.

-    **Preservation**: Data exported from R retains its full descriptive context.

-    **Publication-ready**: Integration with modern repository standards (DataCite, DC Terms).

-    **Tidy + semantic**: Extends tidy principles with semantically rich definitions to avoid misunderstanding data measurement units and other critical attributes.

```{r triples}
dataset_to_triples(my_data, format="nt")
```

```{r print_bibliography}
as_datacite(my_data)
```

The vignette [From R to RDF](https://dataset.dataobservatory.eu/articles/dataset_df.html) explains how you can transform your datasets to be easily used with the [rdflib](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rdflib) R binding that offers exporting (serialisation) to all standard formats to be used in web services.
