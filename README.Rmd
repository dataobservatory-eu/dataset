The primary aim of dataset is create well-referenced, well-described, interoperable datasets from data.frames, tibbles or data.tables that translate well into the W3C DataSet definition within the [Data Cube Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/) in a reproducible manner. The data cube model in itself is is originated in the _Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange_, and it is almost fully harmonized with the Resource Description Framework (RDF), the standard model for data interchange on the web^[RDF Data Cube Vocabulary, W3C Recommendation 16 January 2014  <https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/>, Introduction to SDMX data modeling <https://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/Session_4_SDMX_Data_Modeling_%20Intro_UNSD_WS_National_SDG_10-13Sep2019.pdf>]. 

The development version of the `dataset` package is very significantly differnet from the CRAN release. The documentation has not been rewritten yet!

```{r initialise}
library(dataset)
iris_ds <- dataset(
  x = iris,
  title = "Iris Dataset",
  author = person("Edgar", "Anderson", role = "aut"),
  publisher = "American Iris Society",
  source = "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x",
  date = 1935,
  language = "en",
  description = "This famous (Fisher's or Anderson's) iris data set."
)
```

It is mandatory to add a `title`, `author` to a dataset, and if the `date` is not specified, the current date will be added. 

As the dataset at this point is just created, if it is not published yet, the `identifer` receives the default `:tba` value, a `version` of 0.1.0 and the `:unas` (unassigned) `publisher` field.

The dataset behaves as expected, with all data.frame methods applicable.  If the dataset was originally a tibble or data.table object, it retained all methods of these s3 classes because the dataset class only implements further methods in the attributes of the original object.

```{r}
summary(iris_ds)
```

A brief description of the extended metadata attributes:

```{r describe}
describe(iris_ds)
```
```{r attributes}
# Remove lengthy attributes to see what is going on under the hoods:
iris_ds2 <- iris_ds
attr(iris_ds2, "DataStructure") <- NULL; attr(iris_ds2, "row.names") <- NULL
str(iris_ds2)
```

```{r individualattributes}
paste0("Publisher:", publisher(iris_ds2))
paste0("Rights:", rights(iris_ds2))
paste0("Rights:", rights(iris_ds2))
```

The descriptive metadata are added to a `utils::bibentry` object which has many printing options (see `?bibentry`).

```{r bibentry}
mybibentry <- dataset_bibentry(iris_ds)
print(mybibentry, "text")
print(mybibentry, "Bibtex")
```


```{r prevent-overwrite}
rights(iris_ds2) <- "CC0"
rights(iris_ds2)
rights(iris_ds2, overwrite = FALSE) <- "GNU-2"
```

Some important metadata is protected from accidental overwriting (except for the default `:unas` unassigned and `:tba` to-be-announced values.)

```{r overwrite}
rights(iris_ds2, overwrite = TRUE)  <- "GNU-2"
```


## Code of Conduct
Please note that the `dataset` package is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html). By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

Furthermore, [rOpenSci Community Contributing Guide](https://contributing.ropensci.org/) - *A guide to help people find ways to contribute to rOpenSci* is also applicable, because `dataset` is under software review for potential inclusion in [rOpenSci](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/553).
