\method{is.dublincore}{dublincore}(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object that is tested if it has a class "dublincore".}

\item{type}{The nature or genre of the resource. Recommended best practice is
to use a controlled vocabulary such as the DCMI Type Vocabulary
\href{https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-type-vocabulary/}{DCMITYPE}.
For a dataset, the correct term is \code{Dataset}. To describe the file
format, physical medium, or dimensions of the resource, use the Format
element.}

\item{...}{Optional parameters to add to a \code{dublincore} object.
\code{author=person("Jane", "Doe")} adds an author to the citation object
if \code{type="dataset"}.}

\item{title}{\href{https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/elements11/title/}{dct:title},
a name given to the resource. \code{\link{datacite}} allows the use of
alternate titles, too. See \code{\link{dataset_title}}.}

\item{creator}{An entity primarily responsible for making the resource.
\href{https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/elements11/creator/}{dct:creator}
Corresponds to \code{Creator} in \code{\link{datacite}}. See
\code{\link{creator}}.}

\item{contributor}{An entity responsible for making contributions to the
dataset. See
\href{https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/elements11/contributor/}{DCMI:
Contributor}, and for possible contribution type, please review
\href{https://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/relaterm.html}{MARC Code List for
Relators}.}

\item{publisher}{Corresponds to
\href{https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#publisher}{dct:publisher}
and Publisher in DataCite. The name of the entity that holds, archives,
publishes prints, distributes, releases, issues, or produces the resource.
This property will be used to formulate the citation, so consider the
prominence of the role. For software, use \code{Publisher} for the code
repository. If there is an entity other than a code repository, that
"holds, archives, publishes, prints, distributes, releases, issues, or
produces" the code, use the property
Contributor/contributorType/hostingInstitution for the code repository. See
\code{\link{publisher}}.}

\item{identifier}{An unambiguous reference to the resource within a given
context. Recommended practice is to identify the resource by means of a
string conforming to an identification system. Examples include
International Standard Book Number (ISBN), Digital Object Identifier (DOI),
and Uniform Resource Name (URN). Select and identifier scheme from
\href{https://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi-ieee/identifiers/index.html}{registered
URI schemes maintained by IANA}. More details:
\href{https://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi-ieee/identifiers/}{Guidelines
for using resource identifiers in Dublin Core metadata and IEEE LOM}.
Similar to \code{Identifier} in \code{\link{datacite}}. See
\code{\link{identifier}}.}

\item{subject}{Defaults to \code{NULL}. See \code{\link{subject}} to add
subject descriptions to your dataset.}

\item{dataset_date}{Corresponds to a point or period of time associated with
an event in the lifecycle of the resource.
\href{https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/elements11/date/}{dct:date}.
\code{Date} is also recommended for discovery in \code{\link{datacite}},
but it requires a different formatting. To avoid confusion with
date-related functions, instead of the DCMITERMS date or the DataCite Date
term, the parameter name is \code{dataset_date}.}

\item{language}{A language of the dataset. See
\href{https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/elements11/language/}{DCMI:
Language}.}

\item{relation}{A related resource. Recommended best practice is to identify
the related resource by means of a string conforming to a formal
identification system. See:
\href{https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/elements11/relation/}{dct:relation}.
Similar to \code{RelatedItem} in \code{\link{datacite}}, which is
recommended for discovery.}

\item{format}{The file format, physical medium, or dimensions of the dataset.
See
\href{https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/elements11/source/}{DCMI:
Format}.}

\item{rights}{Corresponds to
\href{https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/elements11/rights/}{dct:rights}
and \code{\link{datacite}} Rights. Information about rights held in and
over the resource. Typically, rights information includes a statement about
various property rights associated with the resource, including
intellectual property rights. See \code{\link{rights}}.}

\item{datasource}{The source of the dataset,
\href{https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/elements11/source/}{DCMI:
Source}, which corresponds to a \code{relatedItem} in the DataCite
vocabulary. We use \code{datasource} instead of \code{source} to avoid
naming conflicts with the}

\item{description}{An account of the resource. It may include but is not
limited to: an abstract, a table of contents, a graphical representation,
or a free-text account of the resource.
\href{https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/elements11/description/}{dct:description}.
In \code{\link{datacite}} it is recommended for discovery. See
\code{\link{description}}.}

\item{coverage}{The spatial or temporal topic of the resource, spatial
applicability of the dataset, or jurisdiction under which the dataset is
relevant. See
\href{https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/elements11/coverage/}{DCMI:
Coverage}.}
}
\value{
\code{dublincore()} creates a \code{utils::\link[utils]{bibentry}}
object extended with standard Dublin Core bibliographical metadata,
\code{as_dublincore()} retrieves the contents of this bibentry object of a
dataset_df from its attributes, and returns the contents as list,
dataset_df, or bibentry object, or an ntriples string.

A logical value, if the bibliographic entries are listed
according to the Dublin Core specification.

\description{
Add metadata conforming the
\href{https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/terms/format/}{DCMI
Metadata Terms}. to datasets, i.e. structured R data.frame or list objects,
for an accurate and consistent identification of a resource for citation
and retrieval purposes.

\details{
The Dublin Core, also known as the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set
(DCMES), is a set of fifteen main metadata items for describing digital or
physical resources, such as datasets or their printed versions. Dublin Core
has been formally standardized internationally as ISO 15836, as IETF RFC
5013 by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), as well as in the U.S.
as ANSI/NISO Z39.85.\cr \cr To provide compatibility with
\code{\link[utils]{bibentry}}  we try to add \code{dataset_date} parameter
first as \code{publication_date} metadata field, and as a \code{year}
field, too. This element can be get or set with
\code{\link{publication_year}}.

The \code{ResourceType} property will be by definition "Dataset".
The \code{Size} attribute (e.g. bytes, pages, inches, etc.) will
automatically added to the dataset.
